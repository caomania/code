Have you drunk enough water today? Maybe Hydrate can help?

Hydrate helps you manage your daily water intake through an attractive and simple interface. Start logging your daily water intake straight away using the simple presets. All the main features are easily accessible from the main screen. Simply add new information with a couple of touches to the screen, or can look back and edit your drinking history via the calendar scroller. You can even remove an entry, if you have made a mistake, by shaking the phone. View a graphical summary by turning your phone to landscape mode.

If you like to customise, you can set your own goals, the amount you drink at one time, as well as the units of measurement that best suit you. There are also instructions on how to get going should you need them.
